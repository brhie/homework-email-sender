# homework-email-sender
This is a gui to send homework to every email inside of a text file.
You will need python3 and PIL library installed.

On the top, you can add email to your list of emails . If you want to delete certain emails or modify it yourself,
click on the 'Change Email List' at the bottom which will open up a text file you can modify.
Please note that when modifying the file, there should be one email in each line and there shouldn't be a blank line.

'user_file.txt' stores user email account and email password. And 'email_list.txt' stores
list of email addresses. With these files, it has a login and change account feature.

Make sure you're using gmail and allowing less secured apps(https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).
