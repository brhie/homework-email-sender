# homework-email-sender
This is a gui to send homework to every email inside of a text file.
You need python3 and PIL library installed.

'user_file.txt' stores user email account and email password. And 'email_list.txt' stores
list of email addresses. With these files, it has a login and change account feature.

Make sure you're using gmail and allow less secured apps(https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).
